          <p>
            The Treasure Hunt event was one of the most thrilling and interactive events organized by the association,
            designed to challenge students’ logic, teamwork, and thinking under pressure.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The event consisted of four creative and adventurous rounds:
          </p>
    
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Round 1: Mobile Quiz Round</strong> – Participants answered a fun mix of movie-based riddles,
              logical questions, and basic math puzzles through an online mobile-based test. This round was both humorous
              and brain-teasing to set the tone for the hunt.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Round 2: Sudoku Round</strong> – Teams that qualified from Round 1 had to solve a time-based Sudoku
              puzzle. The goal was to test analytical thinking and pattern recognition skills under time pressure.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Round 3: Hunting Round</strong> – The real hunt began as participants searched across the college
              campus to find hidden cheats. Each team had to collect four cheats, where each clue led to the next. The
              progress depended entirely on solving the previous clue.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Round 4: Diamond Round</strong> – The final and most exciting round. Shortlisted teams received four
              final cheats containing hints to the exact location of a hidden “diamond.” The last cheat led to the ultimate
              destination. The first team to find it was declared the winner!</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p>
            The event was filled with excitement, suspense, and laughter. It was an outstanding example of how fun learning,
            problem-solving, and teamwork can be when blended with creativity.
