It gives me immense pleasure to extend warm greetings to all members of the Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Student Association (ETESA). This association serves as a vibrant platform for students to nurture their technical, professional, and leadership abilities beyond the classroom environment.
As the Faculty Coordinator, I firmly believe that active participation in such student-led bodies is essential for holistic development. Through ETESA, we aim to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world applications by organizing technical workshops, seminars, industrial visits, project exhibitions, and cultural activities. These initiatives not only strengthen technical proficiency but also foster teamwork, innovation, and communication skills among students.
I encourage each one of you to take full advantage of the opportunities provided, contribute with enthusiasm, and grow as responsible technocrats. Let us work together to make ETESA a platform of excellence, creativity, and unity.
Wishing you all a successful and enriching academic journey ahead.<br>
Warm regards.`

Throughout this period, I led a passionate team to plan and execute a wide range of activities including technical sessions, competitions, industrial visits, social initiatives, and cultural events. We introduced new ideas to engage students from all years and created platforms for them to showcase their skills and talents.

I focused on improving student participation, bringing more collaboration between faculty and students, and ensuring smooth coordination among committee members. Under my leadership, we also improved event planning, documentation, and feedback systems.

This experience helped me grow in areas like decision-making, public speaking, time management, and team motivation. Most importantly, it taught me the value of responsibility and the impact of working together toward a common goal.`
